# xBook
The xBook project describes concepts surrounding the use of the proposed versatile and extensible xBook framework that acts as a brokerage service via an xAPI interface between industry standard ePub3 publications, dynamic external media elements, user-specific performance data, and collaborative learning opportunities in both synchronous and asynchronous learning paradigms to crowdsource learning outcomes and extend the life and value of traditional static digital publication content.
The xBook framework makes extensive use of the xAPI interface to collect human performance data in real-time as the content is being consumed and can dynamically link out to external content or initiate community-based social interaction that enhances and accelerates the learning experience.  The xBook framework adds a dynamic dimension to static content by accessing external resources from Learning Management Systems (LMS), media repositories, digital libraries and Learning Record Stores (LRS) while verifying performance via graphical dashboards.
